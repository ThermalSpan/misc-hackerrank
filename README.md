# Hackerrank Solutions

### What?
These are some of my solutions for hackerrank problems as completed in haskell. There are some interesting tidbits here so I wanted to keep them in an accessable place. That being said, most of the material here is written in a one off mindset, so don't go looking for good formatting. As time goes on I may take some of the algorithms developed here modularize them properly. 

### Where?

I highly recommend spending some time on <a href="https://www.hackerrank.com/">Hackerrank</a>. They have a well organized collection of programming challenges that cover a breadth of subjects. I've used this site for things like familiarizing myself with python, and practicing my understanding of dynamic programming techniques. And now I'm using to help learn haskell.
